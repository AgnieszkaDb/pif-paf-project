# pif-paf-project

This repo contains scripts and data collected for the project on Deep Learning class. The aim of the project is to detect the phenomenon of trigger freeze in shooting sports. Data in the form of an electromyographic signal from the right upper limb was collected using amateur Arduino hardware. Each shot has an assigned class - 0 or 1 (trigger freeze). There is also an additional dataset that consists of audio signals.
